<h3><a name="DODSLEYS_PREFACE" id="DODSLEYS_PREFACE"></a>DODSLEY'S PREFACE.</h3>


<p>I have not been able to discover who was the author
of this piece. But I think it is one of the most remarkable
of our ancient moralities, as it was wrote purposely
to vindicate and promote the Reformation. It was
printed in 1573, and contrived so that four people
might act it; this was frequently done for the convenience
of such as were disposed to divert or improve
themselves, by representing these kinds of entertainments
in their own houses.</p>

<p>[The authorship of "New Custom" remains undiscovered.
It is a piece which may have been written a
few years before it was printed, and is one of the
dramatic efforts in furtherance of the Reformation. At
the same time, there is no apparent foundation for the
hypothesis that the morality was in existence any great
length of time before the date of publication.]</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">All things be not so as in sight they do seem,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatsoever they resemble, or whatever men deem.</div>
  <div class="i0">For if our senses in their own objects us do fail</div>
  <div class="i0">Sometimes, then our judgment shall but little avail</div>
  <div class="i0">In some things, as such, where doubt giveth denial</div>
  <div class="i0">Of them in the best wise to make any trial.</div>
  <div class="i0">Which saying is evident, as well shall appear</div>
  <div class="i0">In this little interlude, which we present here;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whereby we may learn how grossly we err,</div>
  <div class="i0">Taking one thing for another, which differ so far,</div>
  <div class="i0">As good doth from bad. Example therefore</div>
  <div class="i0">You may take by these persons, if you mark no more.</div>
  <div class="i0">For the primitive constitution, which was first appointed</div>
  <div class="i0">Even by God himself and by Christ his annointed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Confirmed by th' Apostles, and of great antiquity:</div>
  <div class="i0">See, how it is perverted by man's wicked iniquity,</div>
  <div class="i0">To be called New Custom or New Constitution,</div>
  <div class="i0">Surely a name of too much ungodly abusion.</div>
  <div class="i0">Which our author, indifferently scanning in his mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">In his simple opinion this cause he doth find:</div>
  <div class="i0">That, by reason of ignorance which beareth great sway,</div>
  <div class="i0">And also stubborn doctrine, which shutteth up the way</div>
  <div class="i0">To all good instruction and knowledge of right:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">No marvel it was, though of the truth we were ignorant quite.</div>
  <div class="i0">For truly in such a case the matter was but small</div>
  <div class="i0">To make the ignorant soul to credit them all,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatsoever they said, were it truth or a lie.</div>
  <div class="i0">For no man able was then to prove them the contrary.</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherefore their own fancies they set in great price,</div>
  <div class="i0">Neglecting the true way, like men far unwise.</div>
  <div class="i0">Making semblant of antiquity in all that they did,</div>
  <div class="i0">To th' intent that their subtlety by such means might be hid.</div>
  <div class="i0">New Custom also hath he named this matter verily,</div>
  <div class="i0">In consideration that the people so speaketh commonly,</div>
  <div class="i0">Confuting the same by reasons most manifest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which in consequent order of talk are exprest.</div>
  <div class="i0">This sense hath our author followed herein, as we said,</div>
  <div class="i0">For other meaning: moreover he will not have it denayed,</div>
  <div class="i0">But diverse may invent much distant from this,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which in no wise he will have prejudicial to his,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor his unto theirs, whatsoever they be,</div>
  <div class="i0">For many heads, many wits,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> we do plainly see.</div>
  <div class="i0">Only he desireth this of the worshipful audience:</div>
  <div class="i0">To take in good part without all manner offence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatsoever shall be spoken, marking the intent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Interpreting it no otherwise but as it was meant.</div>
  <div class="i0">And for us, if of patience you list to attend,</div>
  <div class="i0">We are ready to declare you the matter to the end.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="personae">Perv. Doc.</span> It is even so indeed, the world was never in so evil a state;</div>
  <div class="i0">But this is no time for us of these matters to debate.</div>
  <div class="i0">It were good we invented some politic way</div>
  <div class="i0">Our matters to address in good orderly stay.</div>
  <div class="i0">And for us reason would we looked to ourselves.</div>
  <div class="i0">Do you not see how these new-fangled prattling elves</div>
  <div class="i0">Prink up so pertly of late in every place,</div>
  <div class="i0">And go about us ancients flatly to deface?</div>
  <div class="i0">As who should say in short time, as well learned as we,</div>
  <div class="i0">As wise to the world, as good they might accounted be,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nay, nay, if many years and grey hairs do know no more,</div>
  <div class="i0">But that every peevish boy hath even as much wit in store:</div>
  <div class="i0">By the mass, then, have I lived too long, and I would I were dead,</div>
  <div class="i0">If I have not more knowledge than a thousand of them in my head,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">For how should they have learning that were born but even now?</div>
  <div class="i0">As fit a sight it were to see a goose shod or a saddled cow,</div>
  <div class="i0">As to hear the prattling of any such Jack Straw.</div>
  <div class="i0">For, when he hath all done, I count him but a very daw.</div>
  <div class="i0">As in London not long since, you wot well where,</div>
  <div class="i0">They rang to a sermon, and we chanced to be there.</div>
  <div class="i0">Up stert the preacher, I think not past twenty years old,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a sounding voice and audacity bold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And began to revile at the holy sacrament and transubstantiation:</div>
  <div class="i0">I never heard one knave or other make such a declaration.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, if I had had the boy in a convenient place,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a good rod or twain, not past one hour's space.</div>
  <div class="i0">I would so have scourged my merchant,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that his breech should ache,</div>
  <div class="i0">So long as it is since that he those words spake.</div>
  <div class="i0">What, young men to be meddlers in divinity? it is a goodly sight!</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet therein now almost is every boy's delight,</div>
  <div class="i0">No book now in their hands, but all scripture, scripture:</div>
  <div class="i0">Either the whole Bible or the New Testament, you may be sure.</div>
  <div class="i0">The New Testament for them? and then too for Coll my dog!<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>

  <div class="i0">Or some other trifle to busy their heads withal:</div>
  <div class="i0">Playing at quoits or nine-holes,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or shooting at butts,</div>
  <div class="i0">There let them be, a God's name, till their hearts ache and their guts!</div>
  <div class="i0">Let us alone with divinity, which are of riper age.</div>
  <div class="i0">Youth is rash, they say, but old men hath the knowledge.</div>
  <div class="i0">For while they read they know not what, they omit the verity,</div>
  <div class="i0">And that is now the cause so many fall into heresy,</div>
  <div class="i0">Every man hath his own way, some that and some this,</div>
  <div class="i0">It would almost for anger (sir reverence!<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>) make a man to piss,</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="personae">Ignorance.</span> I fear the same also; but as touching that
whereof you speak full well,</div>
  <div class="i0">They have revoked divers old heresies out of hell.</div>
  <div class="i0">As against transubstantiation, purgatory, and the mass,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="personae">New Cus.</span> When I consider the ancient times before,</div>
  <div class="i0">That have been these eight hundred years and more,</div>
  <div class="i0">And those confer with these our later days,</div>
  <div class="i0">My mind do these displease a thousand ways.</div>
  <div class="i0">For sure he, that hath both perceived aright,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will say they differ as darkness doth from light.</div>
  <div class="i0">For then plain-dealing bare away the prize;</div>
  <div class="i0">All things were ruled by men of good advice;</div>
  <div class="i0">Conscience prevailed much, even everywhere;</div>
  <div class="i0">No man deceived his neighbour and eke a thing full rare</div>
  <div class="i0">It was to find a man you might not trust;</div>
  <div class="i0">But look what once they promised, they did that well and just.</div>
  <div class="i0">If neighbours were at variance, they ran not straight to law:</div>
  <div class="i0">Daysmen<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> took up the matter, and cost them not a straw,</div>
  <div class="i0">Such delight they had to kill debate and strife;</div>
  <div class="i0">And surely even in those days was there more godlier life.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Howbeit men of all ages are wonted to dispraise</div>
  <div class="i0">The wickedness of time that flourished at their days.</div>
  <div class="i0">As well he may discern, who for that but lightly looks,</div>
  <div class="i0">In every leaf almost of all their books.</div>
  <div class="i0">For as for Christ our master, what he thought of Jews,</div>

  <div class="i0">He speaketh honestly yet; but surely, if he rail at me,</div>
  <div class="i0">I may not abide him, by the mass, I promise thee.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="personae">New Cus.</span> Paul to the Corinthians plainly doth tell,</div>
  <div class="i0">That their behaviour pleased him not well.</div>
  <div class="i0">All our forefathers likewise have been offended</div>
  <div class="i0">With divers faults at their time, that might have been amended.</div>
  <div class="i0">The doctors of the church great fault they did find,</div>
  <div class="i0">In that men lived not after their mind:</div>
  <div class="i0">First with the rulers as examples of sin,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then with the people as continuing therein:</div>
  <div class="i0">So that of them both this one thing they thought,</div>
  <div class="i0">That the people was not good, but the rulers were nought.</div>
  <div class="i0">But in comparison of this time of misery,</div>
  <div class="i0">In those days men lived in perfect felicity.</div>
  <div class="i0">Saint Paul prophesied that worse times should ensue,</div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="Latn">In novissimis venient quidam</i>, saith he, this is true,</div>
  <div class="i0">Following all mischief, ungodliness and evil,</div>
  <div class="i0">Leaning to all wickedness and doctrine of the devil;</div>
  <div class="i0">And spake he not of these days, think you, I pray?</div>
  <div class="i0">The proof is so plain that no man can denay:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">For this is sure, that never in any age before</div>
  <div class="i0">Naughtiness and sin hath been practised more,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or half so much, or at all, in respect so I say,</div>
  <div class="i0">And is now (God amend all) at this present day:</div>
  <div class="i0">Sin now no sin, faults no faults a whit:</div>
  <div class="i0">O God, seest thou this, and yet wilt suffer it?</div>
  <div class="i0">Surely thy mercy is great; but yet our sins, I fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are so great, that of justice with them thou canst not bear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Adultery no vice, it is a thing so rife,</div>
  <div class="i0">A stale jest now to lie with another man's wife!</div>
  <div class="i0">For what is that but dalliance? Covetousness they call</div>
  <div class="i0">Good husbandry, when one man would fain have all.</div>
  <div class="i0">And eke alike to that is unmerciful extortion,</div>
  <div class="i0">A sin in sight of God of great abhomination:</div>
  <div class="i0">For pride, that is now a grace; for round about</div>
  <div class="i0">The humble-spirited is termed a fool or a lout.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whoso will be so drunken, that he scarcely knoweth his way,</div>
  <div class="i0">O, he is a good fellow, so now-a-days they say.</div>
  <div class="i0">Gluttony is hospitality, while they meat and drink spill,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which would relieve diverse whom famine doth kill.</div>
  <div class="i0">As for all charitable deeds, they be gone, God know'th;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some pretend lack, but the chief cause is sloth:</div>
  <div class="i0">A vice most outrageous of all others sure,</div>
  <div class="i0">Right hateful to God, and contrary to nature.</div>
  <div class="i0">Scarce blood is punished but even for very shame,</div>
  <div class="i0">So make they of murther but a trifling game.</div>
  <div class="i0">O, how many examples of that horrible vice</div>
  <div class="i0">Do daily among us now spring and arise!</div>
  <div class="i0">But thanks be to God that such rulers doth send,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which earnestly study that fault to amend:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">As by the sharp punishment of that wicked crime</div>
  <div class="i0">We may see that committed was but of late time.</div>
  <div class="i0">God direct their hearts they may always continue</div>
  <div class="i0">Such just execution on sin to ensue;</div>
  <div class="i0">So shall be saved the life of many a man,</div>
  <div class="i0">And God will withdraw his sore plagues from us then.</div>
  <div class="i0">Theft is but policy, perjury but a face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Such is now the world, so far men be from grace.</div>
  <div class="i0">But what shall I say of religion and knowledge</div>
  <div class="i0">Of God, which hath been indifferent in each age</div>
  <div class="i0">Before this? howbeit his faults then it had,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in some points then was culpable and bad.</div>
  <div class="i0">Surely this one thing I may say aright:</div>
  <div class="i0">God hath rejected us away from him quite,</div>
  <div class="i0">And given us up wholly unto our own thought,</div>
  <div class="i0">Utterly to destroy us, and bring us to nought:</div>
  <div class="i0">For do they not follow the inventions of men?</div>
  <div class="i0">Look on the primitive church, and tell me then,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whether they served God in this same wise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or whether they followed any other guise?</div>
  <div class="i0">For since God's fear decayed, and hypocrisy crept in,</div>
  <div class="i0">In hope of some gains and lucre to win,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cruelty bare a stroke, who with fagot and fire</div>
  <div class="i0">Brought all things to pass that he did desire.</div>
  <div class="i0">Next avarice spilt all, which, lest it should be spied,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hypocrisy ensued the matter to hide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then brought they in their monsters, their masses, their light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their torches at noon to darken our sight:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their popes and their pardons, their purgatories for souls:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their smoking of the church and flinging of coals.</div>

<br />
A COMEDY</h2>

<p class="bigger"><span class="smcap">By</span> NICHOLAS UDALL</p>

<p class="bigger">(1550)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>[The only copy known of this admirable comedy, and that
deficient of the title, was discovered in 1818, and is at present in the
library of Eton College. It was reprinted in 1818, again in 1821 and
1830, and for the fourth time, with a copious account of Udall and his
writings, by Mr W. D. Cooper, 1847. It was licensed and probably printed
in 1566, but is quoted in Wilson's "Rule of Reason," 1551, before which
date it was no doubt not only composed but performed.</p>

<p>"Ralph Roister Doister" is the first regular comedy in our
language&mdash;a place of honour long held by "Gammer Gurton's Needle,"
which is an inferior, as well as a later, production.</p>

<p>Since the appearance of Mr Cooper's edition, Mr Furnivall has printed
from the Royal MS. the pageant referred to at p. xiii. of Mr Cooper's
introduction in one of the Ballad Society's volumes.]</p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h3>


<p>John Still, the reputed author of this play, was the
only son of William Still, Esq. of Grantham, in Lincolnshire,
and was born in or about 1543. In 1559 he
matriculated as a pensioner in Christ's College, Cambridge,
proceeded B.A. in 1561-2, and was elected M.A.
in 1565. In 1570 he was presented to the rectory of St
Martin Outwich, London, and in the same year proceeded
B.D. On the 30th July 1571, Archbishop
Parker collated Still to the rectory of Hadleigh, in
Suffolk, and in 1572 the primate, to whom he was
chaplain, appointed him, with Dr Watts, Joint-Dean of
Bocking. Other church preferments followed in quick
succession; but this is perhaps scarcely a place for
entering at large into biographical particulars, more
especially as the authorship of the drama is a little
uncertain. We must content ourselves with noting his
gradual rise from the deanery of Bocking to the canonry
at Westminster, the mastership of St John's College,
Cambridge, the vice-chancellorship of the university on
two occasions, the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and finally, the bishopric of Bath and Wells, to
which last dignity he was named 16 January 1592-3.
He died at the episcopal palace at Wells, February 26,
1607-8, and was buried, on the 4th April following, in
the cathedral, where a handsome monument was
erected to his memory. He was twice married, and
left behind him several children. His excellent
character is attested by Sir John Harington, who
says that he was a man "to whom I never came but
I grew more religious, and from whom I never went
but I parted more instructed." The comedy of "Gammer
Gurton's Needle," the only dramatic product
of his pen of which we have any knowledge, was
"played on stage, in Christ's College, Cambridge," in
the year 1566, and the following entry from the bursars'
books of that college, on the occasion, manifests that
the authorities applied themselves to its production
with spirit. "Item, for the Carpenters setting upp the
Scaffold at the plaie xxd.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>" At this time, Mr Still was
twenty-three years old; but an entry in the registers of
the Stationers' Company, under the year 1563, is considered
by Mr Collier to have very possible reference to the
present comedy, and, in this case, the young clergyman
would have begun, and ended, his authorship ere he
was nineteen: "Received of Thomas Colwell for his
lycense for pryntinge of a play intituled Dyccon of
Bedlam, iiijd." There is no such play, Mr Collier points
out, as "Dyccon of Bedlam," but Diccon of Bedlam is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a principal character in "Gammer Gurton's Needle;"
and it is further to be observed that Thomas Colwell is
the same publisher, "at the sygne of S. John Evangelist,
beneth the Conduit in Fleetestreat," by whom the earliest
known edition of the present comedy was produced.
The circumstance, after all, is as inconclusive as the
fact is immaterial. The true subject of regret is, not
that we cannot determine precisely whether Still wrote
comedy when he was nineteen, or when he was twenty-three,
but that having written one play so well, he did not
write more. Had he so elected to do, indeed, the See of
Bath and Wells might not have seen the name of Still
in its <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Catena Episcoporum</i>, but the other prelate would,
doubtless, have done his duty, and English readers
would have been amused with further Gammer Gurtons.</p>

<p>"Gammer Gurton's Needle," acted at Christ's College,
Cambridge, in 1566, "has," writes Mr Collier, "this
peculiarity belonging to it, that it is the first existing
play acted at either university; and it is a singular coincidence,
that the author of the comedy so represented
should be the very person who, many years afterwards,
when he had become Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge,
was called upon to remonstrate with the Ministers of
Queen Elizabeth against having an English play performed
before her at that university, as unbefitting its
learning, dignity, and character."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Of the play itself
Hazlitt writes: "It is a regular comedy in five acts,
built on the circumstance of an old woman having lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
her needle, which throws the whole village into confusion,
till it is at last providentially found sticking in an
unlucky part of Hodge's dress. This must evidently
have happened at a time when the manufacturers of
Sheffield and Birmingham had not reached the height
of perfection which they have at present done. Suppose
that there is only one sewing-needle in a parish,
that the owner, a diligent, notable old dame, loses it;
that a mischief-making wag sets it about that another
old woman has stolen this valuable instrument of household
industry; that strict search is made in-doors for it
in vain, and that then the incensed parties sally forth
to scold it out in the open air, till words end in blows,
and the affair is referred over to higher authorities; and
we shall have an exact idea (though perhaps not so
lively a one) of what passes in this authentic document
between Gammer Gurton and her gossip Dame Chat;
Diccon, the bedlam (the causer of these harms); Hodge,
Gammer Gurton's servant; Tib, her maid; Cock, her
prentice boy; Doll; Scapethrift; Master Baillie, his
master; Doctor Rat, the curate; and Gib the cat, who
may be fairly reckoned one of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>,
and performs no mean part." "Such," observes the
same critic, further on, characterising the comedy, "Such
was the wit, such was the mirth of our ancestors&mdash;homely,
but hearty; coarse, perhaps, but kindly; let
no man despise it; for "evil to him that evil thinks."
To think it poor and beneath notice, because it is not
just like ours, is the same sort of hypercriticism that
was exercised by the person who refused to read some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
old books because they were "such very poor spelling."
The meagreness of their literary or their bodily fare
was at least relished by themselves; and this is better
than a surfeit or an indigestion. It is refreshing to look
out of ourselves sometimes, not to be always holding
the glass to our own peerless perfections; and as there
is a dead wall which always intercepts the prospect of
the future from our view (all that we can see beyond it
is the heavens), it is as well to direct our eyes now and
then without scorn to the page of history; and repulsed
in our attempts to penetrate the secrets of the next six
thousand years, not to turn our backs on old long syne."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>This entertaining old piece is mentioned in "Histriomastix,"
1610, act ii. (sign. C. 3), under the title of
"Mother Gurton's Needle," and in burlesque it is there
called "a Tragedy."</p>

<p>The present edition of "Gammer Gurton's Needle"
is printed from that of 1575.</p>

<p>The interlude, presented to the modern reader for the
first time in the following pages, was printed from a
copy formerly in the possession of Steevens, the eminent
Shakspearian critic, before it was noticed that a copy in
the British Museum contained several variations and
superior readings.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> These were the more important,
settling in some places the distribution of the speeches
with greater accuracy than they were arranged in the
exemplar we used. Perhaps, indeed, this may in some
measure have arisen from the one last mentioned having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>been what booksellers technically term "cropped," but
we have noticed all variations of importance in the
notes, and some of them seem incompatible with any
supposition, except that there were two different impressions
in the same year,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> or that the Museum copy
had been corrected while the work was in the press.</p>

<p>Mr Collier conjectures that the "Trial of Treasure"
was written some years before it was printed, but subsequently
to the composition of "Lusty Juventus,"
which is, he says, "mentioned in it." But it appears to
me that the allusion to "Lusty Juventus" [p. 263], is
merely a generic proverbial title, and has no reference
whatever to the old play so called. Mr Collier ("Hist.
Dram. Poet." ii., 330), has given a brief analysis of the
interlude now reprinted.</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Diogenes, which used a barrel for his house,</div>
  <div class="i0">Being fled from his father to the city of Athens,</div>
  <div class="i0">Comforted himself much in beholding the mouse,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which desired neither castle nor hold for her defence;</div>
  <div class="i0">Concerning sustentation she made no difference,</div>
  <div class="i0">But ate whatsoever to her did befall,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, touching her apparel, she had least care of all;</div>
  <div class="i0">This poor mouse's property noted Diogenes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which oftentimes also he would have in sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And though he were disciple unto Antisthenes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet he learned of the mouse as much as he might;</div>
  <div class="i0">In the science of 'sophy he had great delight,</div>
  <div class="i0">But concerning his state and outward condition,</div>
  <div class="i0">The most can declare, if you make inquisition.</div>
  <div class="i0">On a time he chanced accompanied to be</div>
  <div class="i0">With Alexander, which stood between him and the sun:</div>
  <div class="i0">What requirest thou to have, Diogenes (quod he)?</div>
  <div class="i0">Is there any thing that by me may be done?</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">I pray thee stand aside, and make a little room</div>
  <div class="i0">(Quod Diogenes), that the sun upon me may shine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nought else require I of that that is thine.</div>
  <div class="i0">He used to say, that as servants be obedient</div>
  <div class="i0">To their bodily masters, being in subjection,</div>
  <div class="i0">Even so evil men, that are not content,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are subjects and slaves to their lusts and affection;</div>
  <div class="i0">This lesson unto us may be a direction</div>
  <div class="i0">Which way our inclination to bridle and subdue,</div>
  <div class="i0">Namely, if we labour the same to eschew.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus see you how little this philosopher esteemed</div>
  <div class="i0">The abundant possessions of this mundane treasure,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which yet, notwithstanding, at these days is deemed</div>
  <div class="i0">To be the original and fountain of pleasure;</div>
  <div class="i0">This causeth lust to reign without measure,</div>
  <div class="i0">To the which men are subjects, Diogenes doth say,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet both lust and treasure in time weareth away.</div>
  <div class="i0">A philosopher is he that wisdom doth love,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which before Pythagoras wise men were named.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, Diogenes being wise, this doth approve</div>
  <div class="i0">That some men of this age ought as fools to be blamed.</div>
  <div class="i0">For where the one with treasure-lack his life framed,</div>
  <div class="i0">The other travail, care, and labour with greediness</div>
  <div class="i0">The same by all means to enjoy and possess.</div>
  <div class="i0">As lust with the lusts converteth to dust,</div>
  <div class="i0">And leaveth of force his pleasant prosperity,</div>
  <div class="i0">So treasure in time is turned to rust,</div>
  <div class="i0">As St James, in his epistle, showeth the verity;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hereof we purpose to speak without temerity,</div>
  <div class="i0">Therefore our matter is named the <cite>Trial of Treasure</cite>,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which time doth expel with all mundane pleasure.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Both merry and short we purpose to be,</div>
  <div class="i0">And therefore require your pardon and patience;</div>
  <div class="i0">We trust in our matter nothing you shall see,</div>
  <div class="i0">That to the godly may give any offence;</div>
  <div class="i0">Though the style be barbarous, not fined with eloquence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet our author desireth your gentle acceptation,</div>
  <div class="i0">And we the players likewise with all humiliation.</div>

  <div class="i1">O wicked imps, that have such delight,</div>
  <div class="i0">In evil conversation wicked and abhoninable:</div>
  <div class="i0">And from virtue's lore withdraw yourselves quite,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lean to vice most vile and detestable.</div>
  <div class="i0">How prone and ready we are vice to ensue?</div>
  <div class="i0">How deaf we be good counsel to hear?</div>
  <div class="i0">How strange we make it our hearts to renew?</div>
  <div class="i0">How little we have God's threats in fear?</div>
  <div class="i0">Saint Augustine say'th in his fifth book, <cite>De Civitate Dei</cite>,</div>

  <div class="i0">The houses of virtue and honour joined together be.</div>
  <div class="i0">And so the way to honour's house is disposed,</div>
  <div class="i0">That through virtue's house he must needs pass:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Or else from honour he shall soon be deposed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And brought to that point, that he before was.</div>
  <div class="i1">But if through virtue honour be attained:</div>
  <div class="i1">The path to salvation may soon be gained.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some there be, that do fortune prefer;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some esteem pleasure more than virtuous life.</div>
  <div class="i0">But in my opinion all such do err;</div>
  <div class="i0">For virtue and fortune be not at strife.</div>
  <div class="i1">Where virtue is, fortune must needs grow:</div>
  <div class="i1">But fortune without virtue has soon the overthrow.</div>

  <div class="i1">That his foes he shall soon tread under foot;</div>
  <div class="i1">And by God's permission pluck them up by the root.</div>
  <div class="i0">It booteth not vice against virtue to stir,</div>

  <div class="i0">Wherefore I would all men would have remorse,</div>

  <div class="i1">Delight in virtuous men, and hate the vicious.</div>
  <div class="i0">And as the end of virtue is honour and felicity,</div>
  <div class="i0">So mark well the end of wickedness and vice!</div>
  <div class="i0">Shame in this world and pain eternally,</div>

  <div class="i0">Sith the thing praiseworthy needs no praise at all?</div>
  <div class="i0">It praiseth itself sufficiently, this is true,</div>

the dog.&mdash;<cite>Steevens.</cite></p>

<p><em>Cowle my dog</em>, I am inclined to believe, means <em>put a cowl
or hood on a dog</em>, and he will be as learned as a friar: the
contempt into which the order had at this period fallen will
at least countenance the explanation, if it should not be
thought sufficient to prove it. I once was of opinion, that
there might be an allusion to the case of one Collins, a crazy
man, who seeing a priest hold up the host over his head,
lifted up a dog in the same manner, for which both he and
the animal were burnt in 1538. See Fox, vol. ii. 436.</p>

<p>My conjecture requires a little explanation. The speaker
means to say, "If the New Testament is fit for the use of
boys, so likewise is it adapted equally to the conception of
<em>Coll my dog</em>. The one will understand and make a proper
use of it as soon as the other."&mdash;<cite>Steevens.</cite> [What will be

p. 131, says: "Over and besides divers other
things touching M. Rogers, this is not to be forgotten, how,
in the daies of King Edward the Sixth, there was a controversie
among the Bishops and Clergie <em>for wearing of
priests caps</em>, and other attyre belonging to that order.
Master Rogers, being one of that number which never went
otherwise than in <em>a round cap</em> during all the time of King
Edward, affirmed that he would not agree to that decreement
of uniformitie, but upon this condition, that if they
would needs have such an uniformitie of wearing the cap,
tippet, &amp;c., then it should be decreed withall, that the
papists, for a difference betwixt them and others, should be
constrained to weare upon their sleeves a chalice with an
host upon it. Whereunto if they would consent, he would
agree to the other, otherwise he would not, he said, consent
to the setting forth of the same, nor ever weare <em>the cap</em>;
nor indeed he never did."</p></div>

<p>A <em>days-man</em>, says Ray, in his "Collection of North

judge. For, as Dr Hammond observes in his Annotation
on Heb. x. 25, p. 752, the word <em>day</em>, in all languages and
idioms, signifies judgment. So <em>man's day</em>, 1 Cor. iii. 13,

poor of every denomination were provided for, there was for
many years no settled or fixed provision made to supply the
want of that care, which those bodies appear always to have
taken of their distressed brethren. In consequence of this
neglect, the idle and dissolute were suffered to wander about
the country, assuming such characters as they imagined
were most likely to insure success to their frauds, and
security from detection. Among other disguises, many
affected madness, and were distinguished by the name of
<cite>Bedlam Beggars</cite>. These are mentioned by Edgar in "King
Lear:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The country gives me proof and precedent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of bedlam beggars who, with roaring voices,</div>
  <div class="i0">Strike in their numbed and mortified bare arms,</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Dekker's "Belman of London" [1608] all the different
species of beggars are enumerated. Amongst the rest
mentioned "Tom of Bedlam's" band of madcaps; otherwise
called Poor Tom's flock of wild geese or hair-brains, are
called Abraham men. An Abraham man is afterwards
described in this manner: "Of all the mad rascalls (that
are of this wing) the <em>Abraham-man</em> is the most phantastick.
The fellow (quoth this old lady of the Lake vnto me) that
sat halfe naked (at table to day) from the girdle vpward, is
the best <em>Abraham-man</em> that euer came to my house, &amp; the
notablest villaine: he sweares he hath bin in bedlam, and will
talke frantickly of purpose: you see pinns stuck in sundry
places of his naked flesh, especially in his armes, which paine
hee gladly puts himselfe to (beeing indeede no torment at
all, his skin is either so dead with some fowle disease, or so
hardened with weather) onley to make you beleeue he is out
of his wits: he calls himselfe by the name of <em>Poore Tom</em>,
and comming neere any body cryes out, Poore Tom is a cold.
Of these <em>Abraham-men</em>, some be exceeding mery, and doe
nothing but sing songs, fashioned out of their owne braines,
some will dance; others will doe nothing but either laugh
or weepe; others are dogged, and are sullen both in looke
and speech, that, spying but small company in a house, they
boldly and bluntly enter, compelling the servants through
feare to giue them what they demaund, which is commonly
<em>bacon</em>, or something that will yielde ready mony." [Edit.
1608, sign. D 2.] Of this respectable fraternity Diccon
seems to have been a member. Massinger mentions them
in "A New Way to Pay Old Debts," act ii., sc. 1: "Are
they padders, or <em>Abraham-men</em>, that are your consorts?"</p></div>

<p>From the following passage, in a letter from Mr Sterne,

still used in the same sense among the common people in
the north of England. "My postilion has set me a-ground
for a week, by one of my pistols bursting in his hand, which
he, taking for granted to be quite shot off, he instantly fell
upon his knees, and said, 'Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,' at which, like a good Christian, he
stopped, not remembering any more of it; the affair was
not so bad as he at first thought, for it has only <em>bursten</em> two

name of a celebrated fool. This I learn from Wilson's
'Art of Rhetorique,' 1553: 'A word making, called of the
Grecians Onomatopiea, is when we make words of our own
mind, such as be derived from the nature of things,' as to
call one <em>patche</em>, or cowlson, whom we see to do a thing
foolishly; because these two in their time were notable
fools.</p>

<p>"Probably the dress which the celebrated <em>patch</em> wore was
in allusion to his name, patched or parti-coloured. Hence
the stage-fool has ever since been exhibited in a motley
coat. In Rowley's 'When you see me, you know me,'
Cardinal Wolsey's fool <em>Patch</em> is introduced. Perhaps he
was the original <em>patch</em> of whom Wilson speaks."&mdash;Note on
"Merchant of Venice," act ii., sc. 5.</p>

<p>In Chaloner's translation of the "Praise of Folly," by
Erasmus, 1549, is the following passage: "And by the
fayeth ye owe to the immortal godds, may any thing to an
indifferent considerer be deemed more happie and blisful
than is this kinde of men whome commonly ye call fooles,
poltes, ideotes, and <em>paches</em>?"</p>

<p>Again, "I have subtraied these my selie <em>paches</em>, who not
onelye themselves are ever mery, playing, singing, and
laughyng, but also whatever they doo, are provokers of
others lykewyse to pleasure, sporte, and laughter, as who
sayeth ordeyned herefore by the Godds of theyr benevolence
to recreate the sadnesse of mens lyves."</p></div>

very ridiculous story of this kind in the first volume of
Lord Oxford's "Collection of Voyages," p. 771, quoted in

<p>The Virgin Mary was the patroness of the town of Boulogne
in a very singular manner, it being holden immediately of
her: "For when King Lewis II., after the decease of Charles
of Burgundy, had taken in Boulogne, anno 1477, as new
Lord of the town (thus John de Serres relateth it), he did
homage without sword or spurs bareheaded, and on his knee,
before the Virgin Mary, offering unto her image an heart of
massie gold, weighing 2000 crowns. He added also this, that
he and his successors, kings after him, should hold the county
of Boulogne of the said Virgin, and do homage unto her
image in the great church of the higher town dedicated to
her name, paying at every change of a vassal an heart of
pure gold of the same weight."&mdash;Heylin's "Survey of
France," 1656, p. 193.</p></div>

concerning them, in which he doubts all the principal facts
in the account of them. See B. vii., c. 8. The celebrated
Thomas Coryat, when at Cologne, took some pains to collect
many circumstances relative to these kings, with which he
hath filled several pages of his book; and to which those

particularly the "Devil is an Ass," by Ben Jonson, act. i.,
sc. 1. From the following passages in "Wily Beguiled,"
1606, we learn the manner in which the character used to be
dressed:&mdash;"Tush! fear not the dodge: I'll rather put on
my flashing red nose and my flaming face, and come wrapp'd
in a calf's skin, and cry, <em>ho, ho</em>," &amp;c. Again, "I'll put
me on my great carnation nose, and wrap me in a rowsing
calf's skin suit, and come like some hobgoblin, or some

the vulgar when they scolded or abused each other. It
occurs again, act v., sc. 2: "That lying <em>cut</em> is lost, that
she is not swinged and beaten."</p>

<p>A horse is sometimes called <em>Cut</em> in our ancient writers,
as in the "First Part of Henry IV.," act ii., sc. 1., and
Falstaff says: "If I tell thee a lye, spit in my face, and
call me <em>horse</em>." <em>Cut</em> is therefore probably used in the same
sense as <em>horse</em>, to which it seems to have been synonymous.
Several instances of the use of this term are collected by
Mr Steevens, in his edition of Shakspeare; see vol. iv.,
p. 202.</p>

<p>It appears probable to me that the opprobrious epithet
<em>Cut</em> arose from the practice of cutting the hair of convicted
thieves; which was anciently the custom in England, as
appears from the edicts of John de Northampton against
adulterers, who thought, with Paulo Migante, that</p>

<p>I find this word used in Nash's "Anatomie of Absurditie,"

growne to such wantonesse, that uppon no occasion they
will crosse the streete, to have a glaunce of some gallant,
deeming that men by one looke of them shoulde be in love
